# BigDecimal Arithmetics
Be as precise as you like (or as much as you can afford in terms of runtime).
BigDecimal#precision is maintained throughout calculations.

Based on [A Java Math.BigDecimal Implementation of Core Mathematical Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3030).
Inspired by [BigDecimalMath.scala](https://gist.github.com/oxlade39/5752033).

## BigDecimalMath
support PI at high precision
TODO complete calculation (with broadhurst method)
## BigIntOps
### extends negate and faculty
## BigDecimalOps
### extends negate, faculty, sin, cos, tan
